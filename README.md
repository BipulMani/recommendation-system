# Movie Recommender System

A simple end-to-end movie recommender built with:

- PyTorch Matrix Factorization
- FastAPI backend for inference
- React frontend for interaction

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `train/`: Training scripts
- `app/backend/`: FastAPI backend + saved models
- `app/frontend/`: ReactJS frontend
## Preview
Here is a little preview of how the app looks like:

## Data
This project uses [MovieLens] (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. Please read the license agreements.

For this project, we used the *ml-latest-small.zip*
You can train it according to the notebook to obtain the weights.

## Training & Saving the model

1. Download the dataset.
2. Train the model from according to the notebook.
3. Save the model weights into backend/assets/. The structure should look like this
```
app\backend\assets
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ kmeans_model.pkl    
â”œâ”€â”€ mappings.pkl        
â”œâ”€â”€ movie_embeddings.npy
â””â”€â”€ movies.csv
```
4. You can then run the backend and the frontend code as described below.


## ðŸš€ Running Locally

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd app/backend
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 1. Frontend

```bash
cd app/frontend
npm install
